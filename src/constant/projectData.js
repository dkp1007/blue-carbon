    longDesc1: "The Alesha project is a vital initiative focused on the restoration and conservation of mangrove forests along the coastal areas near Makassar. Mangroves are one of the planet's most effective carbon sinks, capable of capturing and storing up to four times more carbon than terrestrial forests. This unique ecosystem not only mitigates climate change but also provides a natural barrier against coastal erosion, reducing the impact of storms and rising sea levels on local communities. By safeguarding these areas, the Alesha project ensures the preservation of rich biodiversity, creating a sanctuary for marine species, birds, and other wildlife that rely on mangrove forests for habitat and protection.",
    longDesc2: "Through the Alesha project, users can purchase verified blue carbon credits, allowing them to offset their carbon footprint while directly supporting conservation efforts. Every transaction is securely recorded on the blockchain, ensuring complete transparency and traceability for contributors. These credits represent more than just numbersâ€”they embody a commitment to sustainable development, coastal resilience, and climate action. By participating in this project, contributors are not only investing in environmental restoration but also in the welfare of local communities, which benefit from the improved fishing grounds, job opportunities, and protection that healthy mangroves provide. Alesha exemplifies how innovative solutions like blockchain can empower environmental action, creating a lasting impact for future generation",
