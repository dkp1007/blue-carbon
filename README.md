# 🌊 oCarbn - Visualizing the Power of Blue Carbon  

**Team:** Triple Eliminators  
**Hackathon Theme:** Blue Carbon Emission

## 1. The Problem: A Sinking Solution to a Rising Threat  
The world's oceans are our greatest ally in the fight against climate change. Coastal ecosystems like **mangroves, tidal marshes, and seagrass meadows** are carbon sequestration powerhouses—capturing atmospheric carbon up to **10x faster than mature tropical forests**. This "Blue Carbon" remains locked in soil and sediment for millennia.  

⚠️ However, we are losing these critical habitats at alarming rates:  
- **340,000 to 980,000 hectares destroyed annually**  
- Up to **67% of historical mangrove coverage lost** in some regions  
- Once degraded, ecosystems shift from **carbon sinks to carbon sources**, releasing centuries of stored CO₂ back into the atmosphere  

The **core issue** is a **visibility gap**. The immense value of blue carbon is abstract and difficult for policymakers, corporations, and the public to grasp. We need an **accessible tool** that quantifies this impact and visualizes the benefits of conservation and restoration.

## 2. Our Solution: oCarbn, an Interactive Insight Engine  
**oCarbn** is a **web-based platform** that makes the invisible, visible. It translates complex climate data into a clear, interactive, and actionable experience.  

✅ Users can:  
- Explore global blue carbon ecosystems  
- Calculate their sequestration potential  
- Simulate real-world consequences of destruction vs. restoration  

**Mission:** To empower decision-makers at all levels—**from local communities to international corporations**—with data-driven insights that drive protection and investment in our planet's most effective, yet most threatened, carbon sinks.

## 4. How It Works: User Journey  

1. **Explore** – Navigate the globe to find a coastal region (e.g., **Sundarbans**).  
2. **Analyze** – Click a mangrove forest → dashboard shows area, carbon stock, global significance.  
3. **Simulate** – Enter "1000 hectares" restoration project → choose "Restore" scenario.  
4. **Visualize** – Platform displays:  
   - Additional **~5,000 tonnes of CO₂** sequestered annually  
   - **20-year projection** of carbon locked away  
   - **Market value** of sequestration in carbon credits  
5. **Act** – Get connected to **organizations** restoring the Sundarbans → pathway from **insight to action**

## 6. Vision & Impact  

🌊 Our vision: **oCarbn = the go-to platform for Blue Carbon intelligence**.  

- **Drive Investment** → Help corporations & philanthropists support high-impact projects  
- **Inform Policy** → Equip policymakers with climate impact insights  
- **Raise Awareness** → Educate the public on the vital role of coastal ecosystems  

By **illuminating the true value of blue carbon**, we can turn the tide against its destruction.  

---

## 🚀 Future Goals  
- Expand dataset integrations with **real-time satellite monitoring**  
- Provide **API access** for researchers and governments  
- Launch **community participation modules** (citizen science + local data contribution)  
- Build **mobile-first experience** for wider accessibility
